# Tyr

Tyr aims to become a weighted, annotated, and parallelizable datalog solver based on k-clique enumeration in k-partite graphs (KPKC) with a focus on AI planning. It is currently unknown whether KPKC can efficiently support object creation, and hence, Tyr does not support arithmetic expressions in rule heads. However, it supports simple arithmetic expressions in rule bodies, which are sufficient for deciding whether a ground action in numeric planning is applicable.

# Key Features

- **Datalog Language Support**: relations over symbols, stratifiable programs
- **Language Extensions**: weighted rule expansion, rule annotation, early termination 
- **Parallelized Architecture**: rule parallelization, zero-copy serialization
- **Program Analysis**: variable domain analysis, stratification, listeners
- **Grounder Technology**: k-clique enumeration in k-partite graph (KPKC)

## 3. Example

See [here](https://github.com/drexlerd/Tyr/blob/main/tests/unit/utils.hpp) on how to programmatically instantiate a program to generate the applicable actions in the initial state of a planning task over the Gripper domain with two balls.
