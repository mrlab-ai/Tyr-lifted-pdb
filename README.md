# Tyr

Tyr aims to become a weighted, annotated, and parallelizable datalog solver with a grounder based on k-clique enumeration in k-partite graphs (KPKC) with a focus on AI planning. It is currently unknown whether the KPKC grounder can efficiently support object creation, and hence, Tyr does not support arithmetic expressions in rule heads. However, it supports simple arithmetic expressions in rule bodies, which are sufficient for deciding whether a ground action in numeric planning is applicable. 

Tyr also aims to provides a PDDL interface, which allows the grounding of an *overapproximation* of the applicable ground actions and axioms in a task, or, in a state, *precisely* the ones applicable in that state. Tyr templated design separates grounded and lifted planning: ground tasks use states over the FDR representation, while lifted tasks use states over the sparse representation. This separation enables prototyping with state-of-the-art performance across both subfields, while allowing easy evaluation of approaches across both planning paradigms.

## 3. Datalog Interface

The high level C++ datalog interface aims to be as follows

```cpp
#include <tyr/tyr.hpp>

auto parser = tyr::formalism::Parser("program.dl");

auto program = parser.get_program();
auto static_facts = parser.parse_static_facts("static_facts.dl")
auto fluent_facts = parser.parse_fluent_facts("fluent_facts.dl");
auto goal_facts = parser.parse_goal("goal_facts.dl");

const auto annotated = bool{true};
const auto weighted = bool{true};

// Solver can be reused for different sets of fluent facts
auto solver = tyr::solver::Solver(program, static_facts);

// Solution is a ground facts and rules annotated with achievers and cost
auto solution = solver.solve(fluent_facts, goal_facts, annotated, weighted);

```
  

## 4 PDDL Interface

The high level C++ planning interface aims to be as follows. 

## 4.1 Grounded Planning

```cpp
#include <tyr/tyr.hpp>

auto parser = tyr::formalism::planning::Parser("domain.pddl");
auto task = parser.parse_task("problem.pddl");

// Ground the task
auto ground_task = task.get_ground_task();

// Get the initial node (state + metric value)
auto initial_node = ground_task.get_initial_node();

// Get the labeled successor nodes (pairs of ground action and successor node)
auto successor_nodes = initial_node.get_labeled_successor_nodes();

```

## 4.2 Lifted Planning

```cpp
#include <tyr/tyr.hpp>

auto parser = tyr::formalism::planning::Parser("domain.pddl");
auto task = parser.parse_task("problem.pddl");

// Get the initial node (state + metric value)
auto initial_node = task.get_initial_node();

// Get the labeled successor nodes (pairs of ground action and successor node)
auto successor_nodes = initial_node.get_labeled_successor_nodes();

```
